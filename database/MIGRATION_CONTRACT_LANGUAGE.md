## How to Use This Language

### Step 1: Review MongoDB's Standard Agreement

1. Request a copy of MongoDB's startup grant agreement
2. Identify existing termination and data portability clauses
3. Note any exclusivity or lock-in language

### Step 2: Negotiate Additions

1. **If Agreement is Missing These Clauses:**
   - Request addition of migration rights language
   - Reference industry standards for data portability
   - Emphasize need for flexibility as a startup

2. **If Agreement Has Restrictive Language:**
   - Request removal or modification of exclusivity clauses
   - Negotiate for data portability rights
   - Ensure termination rights are clear

3. **If Agreement is Non-Negotiable:**
   - Review MongoDB's standard data export capabilities
   - Document your understanding of termination rights
   - Consider legal review if concerns remain

### Step 3: Document Your Understanding

Even if you can't modify the contract, document:

```
SIDE LETTER OR EMAIL CONFIRMATION

Subject: Clarification of MongoDB Startup Grant Terms

Dear MongoDB Team,

I am writing to confirm our understanding of the startup grant 
agreement terms, specifically regarding:

1. Data Ownership: We retain full ownership of our data
2. Data Export: We can export our data at any time in standard formats
3. Termination: We can terminate services with 30 days notice
4. Migration: We can migrate to alternative solutions without restriction
5. No Exclusivity: We can use multiple database solutions concurrently

Please confirm if this understanding is correct, or let us know 
if there are any restrictions we should be aware of.

Thank you,
[Your Name]
```

## Legal Considerations

### Important Notes

⚠️ **Legal Review Recommended:** Have a lawyer review any contract modifications

⚠️ **Standard Agreements:** MongoDB may have non-negotiable standard terms

⚠️ **State Laws:** Contract enforceability varies by jurisdiction

⚠️ **Industry Standards:** Data portability is becoming an industry standard

### What to Look For

**Red Flags:**
- ❌ Exclusivity clauses requiring MongoDB-only usage
- ❌ Penalties for early termination
- ❌ Restrictions on data export
- ❌ Automatic conversion to paid plans
- ❌ Minimum usage commitments

**Green Flags:**
- ✅ Clear data ownership language
- ✅ Standard data export formats
- ✅ Reasonable termination terms
- ✅ No exclusivity requirements
- ✅ Migration support provisions

---

## Alternative Approaches

### If Contract Modification Isn't Possible

**Option 1: Side Agreement**
- Create a separate side letter confirming understanding
- Document data portability rights
- Clarify termination process

**Option 2: Technical Preparation**
- Build abstraction layer (see Connection Guide)
- Test data export processes
- Prepare migration scripts
- Document data structures

**Option 3: Legal Review**
- Have lawyer review standard agreement
- Identify any hidden restrictions
- Understand your rights under standard terms
- Document any concerns

Subject: Questions About Startup Grant Agreement Terms

Hi MongoDB Team,

Thank you for the startup grant opportunity. Before we proceed, 
I'd like to clarify a few points about the agreement terms:

1. Data Ownership: Do we retain full ownership of our data?

2. Data Export: Can we export our data at any time in standard 
   formats (JSON, CSV, BSON)?

3. Termination: Can we terminate MongoDB Atlas services with 
   30 days notice without penalty?

4. Migration: Are we free to migrate to alternative database 
   solutions (like Supabase or PostgreSQL) at any time?

5. Exclusivity: Are we required to use MongoDB exclusively, or 
   can we use multiple database solutions?

6. Grant Expiration: What happens when the grant expires? Are 
   we obligated to continue using MongoDB Atlas?

I want to ensure we have flexibility as a startup to choose 
the best solutions for our needs. Please let me know if there 
are any restrictions we should be aware of.

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```
